Todo
- Instead of exporting two files, it would be better if I just made an interpreter of the .kgl file. Could be written in odin. We could totally call it from python too.
- Some fence posts fall through the ground. They might not have collision hulls or something.

I'm questioning if the impulse clamping is correct. When the object has a large overshoot (due to a small delta time) we're seeing iterations which could be spent correcting
the impulse but they don't do anything. Maybe this is correct behavior and I need to put a lower bound on delta time, maybe the clamping logic is incorrect, need to investigate.
	- Need to check this again given the fix we made for the other issue

Exporter
- Remove the text file exporting. Make a translator from the binary file to the text file.
- Make better procs, i.e. a proc that get the indices and positions and exports it all in one. Combine the functionality into one. Make a single export hulls proc.
- I think just make a get_indices_global_positions proc even if it's just used once.
