Todo
- Convert all the vulkan struct initialization to use the other struct syntax
- Use built in assert instead of fmt.assertf()
- Use built in panic instead of fmt.panicf()
- Have the application compile the shaders if there are new changes. (When running in debug mode)
- Instead of exporting two files, it would be better if I just made an interpreter of the .kgl file. Could be written in odin.

Path forward
- [done] Lambert pipeline
- Export scene in custom binary format
- Read in scene file
